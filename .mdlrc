# Disable rules that don't apply to Jekyll sites with HTML components
# MD002/MD041 - First header level (Jekyll adds h1 from layout)
# MD013 - Line length (prose doesn't need line breaks)
# MD022/MD032 - Blank lines around headers/lists (Jekyll handles fine)
# MD024 - Duplicate headers (intentional in different sections)
# MD026 - Trailing punctuation ("Questions?" headers are fine)
# MD029 - Ordered list prefix (1,2,3 is valid markdown)
# MD033 - Inline HTML (intentional for Jekyll components)
# MD036 - Emphasis instead of header (styling choice)
