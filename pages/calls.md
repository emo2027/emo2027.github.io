## Submission Guidelines

### Paper Format

Papers should not exceed **15 pages** including references and appendices.
<!-- COMMENTED OUT - awaiting official Springer confirmation: Papers must be submitted in **Springer LNCS format** and should not exceed... -->

- Papers must be submitted as PDF files
- All submissions must be original and not under review elsewhere
- Formatting guidelines will be announced soon
<!-- COMMENTED OUT - awaiting official Springer confirmation: - LaTeX template: [LNCS Author Guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) -->

### Submission System

<div class="info-box tbd">
  <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
  <p>The submission system will be announced in early 2026.</p>
</div>

### Review Process

All submissions will undergo a **double-blind peer review** by at least three members of the Program Committee. Authors should ensure their submissions are properly anonymized:

- Remove author names and affiliations from the manuscript
- Avoid self-references that reveal identity (use "previous work [X]" instead of "our previous work [X]")
- Remove identifying information from file metadata

## Publication

Publication details will be announced soon.

<!-- COMMENTED OUT - awaiting official Springer confirmation:
Accepted papers will be published in **Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)** and indexed in major databases including:

- Scopus
- Web of Science
- DBLP
- Google Scholar

Selected high-quality papers may be invited for extension and submission to special issues in leading journals.
-->

## Presentation Requirements

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference at the **full registration rate** and present the paper in person. Papers without a registered presenter will not be included in the proceedings.

## Special Sessions and Tutorials

### Special Sessions

We invite proposals for **special sessions** focusing on emerging topics within the scope of EMO. Special session proposals should include:

- Title and brief description (200-300 words)
- Names, affiliations, and brief bios of organizers
- List of potential contributors (if available)
- Relevance to the EMO community

### Tutorial Proposals

We also welcome proposals for **tutorials** on topics relevant to the EMO community. Tutorial proposals should include:

- Title and abstract (300-500 words)
- Intended audience and prerequisites
- Outline of the tutorial content
- Duration (half-day or full-day)
- CV of the presenter(s)
